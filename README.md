# The Italian Fusion

## 1.0
A personal project of mine where I have developed the Web Page for a Fictious Restaurant named "The Italian Fusion".


Viewed best in fullscreen devices with screen width greater than 1080px. However the pages have been optimised for all cases. 


The page has the "Login" tab as empty as I haven't been able to write the code to create the Food Blog of the "The Italian Fusion" yet.

## 2.0

The "Login" tab has been updated. Created a custom design to enter username password and press login button. However no PHP script has been written yet to store/retrieve the data from user.

Hope to do that in future soon.

Hope you guys like it. :)
